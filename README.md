# tutorial-basic

A series of tutorials to walk you through our best practices. 

Hosted online at <https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial-basic/>

Topseed aims to be a showcase of best practices and approaches for designers, digital creatives and front end developers
who want to build stunning mobile-first web apps with some of the best technologies available now.

What technologies make our cut? Those that let us be the most
productive and creative. And that we know to be maintainable. And that we expect 
to be future-safe.

We welcome scrutiny and feedback from anyone who tries to follow our approaches. 
We also welcome code contributions from seasoned designers and developers.

## Some best practices:
- Static site based (ex: WinterSmith.io) and serverless.
- DOM centric to be more friendly with team that includes interactive designers that code
- Use page transitions for a Single Page Application (SPA) feel that works with SEO
- Can be static (serverless), deployed to CDN edge cache to scale (fetch() microservices)
- Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
- Native Mobile Apps (Phonegap/Cordova) 
- Server side data-binding and in-browser data binding
- Use component libraries
- Use Material Design, SASS, and BEM Standard
- Use Pug to improve reuse and reduce maintenance costs.
