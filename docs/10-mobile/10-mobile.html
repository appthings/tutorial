<h2 id="lab-10-mobile-app-phonegap-">Lab 10: Mobile App (Phonegap)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>In this Lab we will customize and install an Android app that uses the Cordova In-App Browser to provide a rich UI. Download and unzip topseed-mobile-master.zip from <a href='https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile' target='_blank'>https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile</a> to your location of choice on your developer machine. Open the project in VS Code. Download, install and run the Phonegap Desktop App from <a href='https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases' target='_blank'>https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases</a>. In Phonegap Desktop, add the &#39;/topseed-mobile&#39; folder as a Project, and click the &#39;&gt;&#39; button. A message &#39;Server is running on ...&#39; should come up. Click on the URL to open the App in a browser. Resize the browser to mobile phone format. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The app is configured to show a splash screen and then display content obtained from https://m.appthings.io. We will make it display the content you published to the CDN in Lab 3 instead. As you edit the project, the Phonegap Desktop App watches for changes in the /www folder of the project and attempts to refresh the browser view on each change. In /www/js/index.js, replace the URL following &#39;window.open&#39; with the homepage URL of the helloworld app you deployed in Lab 3, i.e. your equivalent of &#39;https://staging.mydomain.com/page/one/index.html&#39;. If you only deployed to the CDN or zeit.co, use your equivalent of &#39;https://1234567890.rsc.cdn77.org/page/one/index.html&#39;. or &#39;https://demos-oosnsyzlphl.now.sh/page/one/index.html&#39;. If you never deployed, you can use the published version of this tutorial at &#39;https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial/0-agenda/index.html&#39;. We include &#39;/index.html&#39; in the path to ensure we deliver the turbo (non-AMP) version of the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To allow the in-app browser to navigate to the newly configured URL, in /config.xml &lt;allow-navigation href=&quot;https://m.appthings.io/*&quot; /&gt;, replace &#39;m.appthings.io&#39; with your equivalent from the previous step. The app should now display your site at the 
Phonegap Desktop App Server URL. It is a labor of love to replace the splash screen logo (at /www/css/index.css) and the icons used by the phone operating system (see /config.xml &#39;icon&#39; values) with your own; we will skip over it here. Optional: change the values for the app &#39;name&#39; and &#39;version&#39; in /config.xml.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To install the customized app on an Android phone, 
first create a zip file of the contents of the project folder /topseed-mobile. Create an account and login at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a>. 
On the &#39;Apps&#39; tab at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com/apps' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com/apps</a>, click the &#39;+ new app&#39; button and upload the zip file (If your project is in Github, you can use the github clone URL instead). The site will take a few moments to build the app. Meanwhile, also log into <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a> on your mobile phone. Once the build has completed, on your phone download, install and run the version for your phone&#39;s operating system (here: Android). Follow the installation prompts. Done! For fun, close the app and reopen it by tapping on the app icon on your phone UI.</p>
</li>
<li><p>See <a href='http://docs.phonegap.com/' target='_blank'>http://docs.phonegap.com/</a> for further information about phonegap, for instruction how to deploy to Apple iOS,and how your app can access phone-specific APIs, such as address book, location information etc if necessary. We would use a &#39;service worker&#39; to support offline-browsing as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In this Lab, we have used the Cordova In-App Browser to render app content from a CDN. As shown in Lab 6, the app can also obtain data securely from separate API servers. Thanks to appshell, Turbo and caching introduced in Lab 4, the app has a smooth &#39;single page application&#39; feel. As a result, we were able to develop a rich mobile app without requiring special Android SDK/iOS development skills. </p>
