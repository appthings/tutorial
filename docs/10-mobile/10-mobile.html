<h2 id="lab-10-mobile-app-phonegap-">Lab 10: Mobile App (Phonegap)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>In this Lab we will build, customize and install an Android app that uses the Cordova In-App Browser to provide a rich UI. Download and unzip topseed-mobile-master.zip from <a href='https://github.com/topseed/topseed-mobile' target='_blank'>here</a> to your location of choice on your developer machine. Open the project in VS Code. Download and install the Phonegap Desktop App from <a href='https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases' target='_blank'>here</a>. Run the app, add the &#39;/topseed-mobile&#39; folder as a Project, and click the &#39;&gt;&#39; button. A message &#39;Server is running on ...&#39; should come up. Click on the URL to open the App in a browser. The app is configured to show a splash screen and then display the content from <a href="https://m.appthings.io">https://m.appthings.io</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Let us customize the app for your needs. As you do this, Phonegap Desktop App will watch for changes in the /www folder of the project and refresh the browser view on each change.
Replacing the logo used on the splash screen (at /www/css/index.css) and the icons used by the phone operating system with your own (see /config.xml &#39;icon&#39; values) is a labor of love and we will skip over it here.
However, we will make the app display the content you published to the CDN in Lab 3. 
In /www/js/index.js, replace the URL following &#39;window.open&#39; with the homepage URL of the helloworld app you deployed in Lab 3, i.e. your equivalent of &#39;<a href="https://staging.mydomain.com/page/one/index.html">https://staging.mydomain.com/page/one/index.html</a>&#39;. If you only deployed to the CDN, use your equivalent of <a href="https://1234567890.rsc.cdn77.org/page/one/index.html">https://1234567890.rsc.cdn77.org/page/one/index.html</a>&#39;. If you only deployed to Zeit.co, use your equivalent of  &#39;<a href="https://demos-oosnsyzlphl.now.sh/page/one/index.html">https://demos-oosnsyzlphl.now.sh/page/one/index.html</a>&#39;. If you never deployed, you can use the published version of this tutorial at &#39;<a href="https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial/0-agenda/index.html">https://docs.topseed.io/tutorial/0-agenda/index.html</a>&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To allow the in-app browser to navigate to the newly configured URL, in /config.xml, replace &#39;m.appthings.io&#39;  \<allow-navigation href="https://m.appthings.io/*" /\> with your equivalent. The app should now display your site at the 
Phonegap Desktop App Server URL.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To install the customized app on an Android phone, create an account and login at <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a>. You will be prompted to create an Adobe ID if you don&#39;t have one. 
Create a zip file of the contents of the project folder /topseed-mobile.
On the <a href='https://build.phonegap.com/apps' target='_blank'>&#39;Apps&#39; tab </a>, click the &#39;+ new app&#39; button and upload the zip file. The site will take a few moments to build the app. Meanwhile, also log into <a href='https://build.phonegap.com' target='_blank'>https://build.phonegap.com</a> on your mobile phone. Once the build has completed, follow the prompts to download, install and run the version for your phone&#39;s operating system (we assume Android here). </p>
</li>
<li><p>See <a href='http://docs.phonegap.com/' target='_blank'>http://docs.phonegap.com/</a> for further information about phonegap, and details how to deploy to Apple iOS,and how your app can access phone-specific APIs, such as address book, location information etc. We would use a service worker to support offline-browsing as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have used the Cordova In-App Browser to render app content from a CDN. As shown in Lab 6, the app is able to securely obtain data from separate API servers. Because we have ensured that the app has a smooth &#39;single page application feel&#39; (using topseed-turbo), we were able to deliver a quality mobile app without requiring Android SDK/iOS development skills. </p>
