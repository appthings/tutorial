## Lab 2: The Basics - Material Design, SASS and Pug

1. Ensure you have the sample project topseed-helloworld open in VS Code and Prepros running on the /topseed-webroot folder. Per Lab 1, make sure the home page is running in a browser.

2. Visit and browse these sites: <a href='http://materialpalette.com' target='_blank'>http://materialpalette.com</a>, <a href='https://design.google' target='_blank'>https://design.google</a>, <a href='https://material.io' target='_blank'>https://material.io</a> and
<a href='https://material.io/guidelines/#' target='_blank'>https://material.io/guidelines/#</a>. We follow Material design guidelines, put forward by Google, to make our sites and mobile apps look better. 

3. Find /_sass/main.css in the home page source, and inspect it. Other than fonts, all CSS used on the site is in this one CSS.

4. Visit <a href='https://www.muicss.com' target='_blank'>https://www.muicss.com</a>. Read 'Getting Started/Introduction', then browse the section 'CSS/JS'. We use the MUI CSS libraries in our project. Inspect /_sass/_base.scss in /helloworld-webroot. SCSS is CSS with some added features, such as $variables and @import. You can turn any CSS file into SCSS just by changing the ending to .scss.

5. Inspect _sass/_colors.scss in /helloworld-webroot. See a color scheme we generated with materialpalette.com. Use /\* \*/ to comment it out. Go back to <a href='http://materialpalette.com' target='_blank'>http://materialpalette.com</a>, pick two colors, download your own palette in CSS format and paste it after the section you commented out. Save, refresh the browser; you should see your new color scheme applied to the site. Revert to the palette you had commented out.

6. Inspect `/_sass/main.sass`. SASS uses a special syntax without the curly braces or ';' at the end of a line that are used in CSS (and SCSS). SASS can also use SCSS imports such as `@import '_base'`. Prepros compiles the `.sass` and its dependent `.scss` imports into the single `main.css` used in the browser. In Prepros Files select _main.sass, check 'Minify Css', and click Process File. Open `/_sass/main.css` and see that it is now minified.

7. Inspect `/page/two/_buttons.html`. Copy the entire HTML. Go to <a href='http://html2jade.org' target='_blank'>http://html2jade.org</a> (Pug used to be called Jade) and paste this html. In the right pane you see Pug markup, a way to write html without having to
worry about closing tags. We write Pug. 

8. Inspect the code snippet at `/page/two/_buttons.pug`. It should match the output of html2jade. Every `.pug` file in the project has a corresponding `.html` used by the browser, with the exception of include's within another pug file. Inspect `/page/two/index.pug` to find the `'include _buttons'`. Inspect `/page/two/index.html` to find the generated buttons HTML.

9. Watch the video 'Do you Even JADE bro' at <a href-"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzAWI9h3q18</a>. Once you know how to write Pug, you can generate beautiful HTML quickly.
