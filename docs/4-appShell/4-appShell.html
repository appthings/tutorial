<li><p>Inspect /helloworld-webroot/page/one/index.pug and its equivalent at /page/two/index.pug. These Pug files show how parts of the html pages that both pages have in common are used in both. Both pages use or &#39;extend&#39; the TEMPLATE /_part/_baseShell.pug. The template has &#39;blocks&#39; named &#39;head&#39;, &#39;main&#39;, and &#39;footer&#39;. The pages that use this template define how to replace these blocks. For example, /page/one/index.pug defines that the head block consists of a page-specific title tag and an included fragment /_part/_header.pug. The same fragment is also used by /page/two/index.pug.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inspect /helloworld-webroot/_part/_top.pug. This fragment represents the top menu and side drawer used on all pages. You can find it referenced in /_part/_baseShell.pug as &#39;include _top&#39;. Now inspect /page/one/index.html. This is the complete HTML which Prepros has collatesd together from template and fragments. Since the server has been configured to return the &#39;default&#39; page index.html when the browser requests /page/one/, this is what the end user sees. </p>

<li><p>To give the application a &#39;Single-Page Application&#39; feel, we use an optional Javascript library called topseed-turbo. </p>
