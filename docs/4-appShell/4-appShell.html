<ol>
<li><p>Inspect <code>/helloworld-webroot/page/one/index.pug</code> and <code>/page/two/index.pug</code>. These Pug files show how the parts of the HTML they have in common are pulled from central places. Both pages use or &#39;extend&#39; the TEMPLATE <code>_part/_baseShell.pug</code>. Open this template file, and see that it has &#39;blocks&#39; named <code>&#39;head&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;main&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;footer&#39;</code>. The Pug pages that extend this template define how to replace these blocks. For example,<code>/page/one/index.pug</code> defines that the head block consists of a page-specific title tag and an included fragment <code>_part/_header.pug</code>. The same <code>_header.pug</code> is re-used by <code>/page/two/index.pug</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inspect <code>/helloworld-webroot/_part/_top.pug</code>. This fragment represents the top menu and side drawer used on all pages. You can find it referenced in <code>/_part/_baseShell.pug</code> as <code>&#39;include _top&#39;</code>. Now inspect <code>/page/one/index.html</code>. This is the complete HTML which Prepros has collated together from template and fragments. Since the server has been configured to return the &#39;default&#39; page <code>index.html</code> when the browser requests <code>/page/one/</code>, this is what the end user sees. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You have seen that a pug template or fragment can include other pug fragments. It can also include a fragment which is already in HTML format, such as <code>/page/one/_hello.html</code> included in <code>/page/one/index.html</code>. The file <code>_hello.html</code> is the result of processing the markdown file <code>_hello.md</code>. We find that Pug is not only a great way to write clean HTML, it is also very useful for defining layouts and reusing page elements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>To give the application a <em>Single-Page Application feel</em>, we use an optional JavaScript library called topseed-turbo (&#39;TT&#39;). When a user navigates from one URL to the next, TT replaces only the part of the HTML body that is unique to each page (The section marked &#39;#content-wrapper&#39; in <code>_baseShell.pug</code> and <code>/_js/main.js</code>). TT is unobtrusively loaded by JavaScript included in the <code>_header.pug</code> section (<code>/setup-x.x.js</code>). Using TT avoids &#39;page flash&#39; and makes for smoother navigation, very similar to a native <em>rich client app</em> where only individual panels are replaced on navigation. Smoother navigation increases the perceived performance of the application.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: Advanced JavaScript users may be interested to look at <code>TS.onAppReady(UIinit)</code> in <code>/page/one/index.pug</code>. TS stands for &#39;topseed-setup&#39;. TS receives an event when the <code>#content-wrapper</code> HTML is fully present in the browser (similar to a &#39;pageLoaded&#39; event). When using <em>TT</em>, <code>TS.onAppReady</code> provides an important hook for page-specific JavaScript that requires the DOM to be fully initialized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rename <code>/helloworld-webroot/cache.mfx</code> to <code>/cache.mf</code> and inspect it. The <em>AppCache</em> is a good way to improve performance of a web application. The file is referred to as <em>manifest</em> in <code>_part/_baseshell.pug</code>.  If the manifest file is present, the browser will keep its listed resources in the browser cache &#39;forever&#39;, and serve them from there, without going to the network, until the <code>cache.mf</code> file itself changes. You can see what the browser does with the appcache if you run a page in Developer mode (hit <code>Ctrl-Shift+i</code> and select the &#39;Console&#39; tab in your Chrome browser). For development, we disable the appcache by renaming it from <code>.mf</code> to <code>.mfx</code>. If you ever suspect the browser having cached an older version of a resource, right-click the refresh button on the left of the URL in the Chrome browser (with Developer Console open) and select &quot;Empty Cache and Hard Reload&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We also achieve performance gains by setting response headers in <code>Decider.js</code> to allow caching of content at the CDN <em>edge</em> as described in Lab 4.</p>
