<h2 id="lab-8-login-security-and-tokens">Lab 8: Login Security and Tokens</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Until now we had login security for the Admin module disabled. Inspect /admin/login/index.pug, and look for &#39;//sb.redirect(&#39;/admin/home/&#39;). Uncomment it by removing &#39;//&#39;. Ensure the API service is running. Return to the home page at <a href='http://localhost:8091/' target='_blank'>http://localhost:8091/</a>, and click the &#39;Admin&#39; menu item to see the login prompt. Use &#39;demo&#39;:&#39;demo&#39; as username:password and click &#39;Login&#39;. In VS Code, return to /admin/login/index.pug. See how we open the modal dialog, bind the form and register the form submit. Modal dialogs are natively supported by the Chrome browser. We use a &#39;polyfill&#39; (loaded in /_js/admin.js) for compatibility with other browsers (Edge and IE need a little bit of CSS love). LoginBusiness &#39;login()&#39; contacts the API server (it could be a separate server dedicated to authentication). If the credentials match, LoginBusiness receives an &#39;OK&#39; response, and we redirect to /admin/home/. If an authentication error is received, we display it in a div with id &#39;error&#39; on the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Along with the &#39;OK&#39; response, the API server returned a &#39;token&#39; string. We store the token as a cookie (name: &#39;auth&#39;) in the browser. After the initial login, we use this token on all pages and for all API calls that require auhentication. While instead we could have stored username and password as a cookie, the advantage of using a token after initial authentication is that it can be heavily encoded (by the server). For maximum security and defense against network sniffing, the token could even be changed on every request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To protecte the Linkblog pages with a login, open /admin/linkblog/index.pug and /detail.pug and uncomment //sb.ensureLogin(...). This function checks for the existence of the &#39;auth&#39; cookie. If this cookie doesn&#39;t exist, it means that the user has not logged in, and he is redirected to the login screen. We destroy the &#39;auth&#39; cookie on logout; see &#39;script.&#39; in /admin/logout/index.pug. Logout is triggered when clicking the admin menu &#39;Logout&#39; item.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is one more thing to improve. In our flow, on full page refresh, the browser renders the static parts of the page before ensuring login. The ugly result is that the admin menu bar, static page content and footer may briefly display before a redirect to the login page happens. This is by design; we allow a CDN to cache the static (non-data) parts of admin module pages. However, we can apply a visual improvement to achieve better transitions. Open &#39;_sass/admin.sass&#39; and uncomment the last two lines, beginning with &#39;//body > *&#39;. This sets the opacity of the immediate children of the admin html body to a very low 0.1 by default (You can set it to 0, if you prefer). Linkblog.ensureLogin sets the opacity to 1 when the user has been confirmed to have successfully logged in, causing the page to display in full. Save admin.sass and try the login routine again to see the result.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For additional security, we send the token along when we make requests to the API server. If the API server is configured to require authentication, we ensure that the specific token received allows reading or writing the data before returning the data. If the token is not valid, we let the API service return a 403 &#39;Forbidden&#39; error. When LinkblogBusiness receives such an error, we show an alert and redirect to the login page. Open /bsrv/config/ApiConfig.js to configure which API calls are to be secured. In the line for &#39;get REQUIRE_AUTH&#39;, uncomment &#39;write&#39; so that it reads &#39;linkblog: [&#39;write&#39;]&#39;. Restart the server in the terminal window. This activates the token check in /bsrv/scode/route/LinkblogService.js in &#39;router.post(&#39;. The class TokenAuth contains our very simple Authentication functionalities: validate that username:password match demo:demo, and token always matches &quot;abc&quot;. </p>
</li>
<li><p>You just activated token security for the Linkblog write (=save) function. Let&#39;s inspect how the token is passed to the API. In /admin/linkblog/detail.pug, with &#39;$(&#39;#form1&#39;).submit({auth: Cookies.get(&#39;auth&#39;)}, sb.save)&#39; we instruct to include the auth cookie as event data when calling LinkblogBusiness.save. In LinkblogBusiness &#39;save&#39;, we pass it on to the DAO in &#39;sb.linkblogDao.update(formData, e.data.auth)&#39;. This continues through BDS.js update, _post and fetch_ functions, where the token is  passed to the API as &#39;X-JToken&#39; header. If configured as described above, in /bsrv/scode/route/LinkblogService.js the API reads this header and validates the token by calling &#39;/bsrv/scode/route/ds/TokenAuth.js &#39;isTokenValidPromise&#39;. 
Inspect this function. The returned promise throws an &#39;invalid token&#39; error in the case of failure, which causes LinkblogService to abandon the update request and return a 403 error &#39;Forbidden&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reopen /admin/linkblog/LinkblogBusiness.js and find &#39;const _updatePromise&#39;. Here follows what happens in the UI as a result of the update attempt. If the update/save was successful, we redirect to the linkblog list page. If it failed because the token did not validate (&#39;Forbidden&#39;), show an alert and redirect to the login page. In case of other failures, simply show an alert. If you wish to simulate the errors, go to /admin/linkblog/detail.pug and make it send an invalid token with &#39;$(&#39;#form1&#39;).submit({auth: &#39;xyz&#39;}, sb.save)&#39;. Attempt to add and save a new linkblog item. Revert to &#39; $(&#39;#form1&#39;).submit({auth: Cookies.get(&#39;auth&#39;)}, sb.save)&#39; when done. Since our linkblog is expected to be public, we didn&#39;t implement authentication for the linkblogDAO.selectList API call, but this could easily be added.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This Lab demonstrated the fundamentals of the two principal authentication flows: login and token validation. A &#39;real life&#39; authentication provider would likely be more advanced than TokenAuth.js. Tokens might need to be encoded and decoded. A production implementation might access a database of credentials, an in-memory database of valid tokens, or an asynchronously called external authentication service that may return its own promises for credential and token validations. In the shown implementation, sucessful login always redirects to the admin landing page. For production, we would probably enhance the login flow by keeping track of which protected page was requested and redirect to it after successful login. </p>
