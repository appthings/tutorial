      <div class="mui-container-fluid"><h2 id="lab-9-standard-web-components-and-their-communication">Lab 9: Standard Web Components and their Communication</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>The quest for the web equivalent of &#39;Legos&#39; has been going on for a while. Legos are composable: you can connect pieces in different ways. They are reusable: the same kind of piece can be used in multiple places. Legos are also modular: you can connect one assembly to another one. Unlike Legos <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1068475467/brixo-building-blocks-meet-electricity-and-iot' target='_blank'>(mostly; google kickstarter brixo )</a>, however, components for the web also need to be able to communicate with each other and with the outside world. Finally, web components need to be insulated (in Lego terms, the color of one item must not &#39;bleed&#39; into others). CSS &#39;bleed&#39; has been a particular problem of older web component frameworks. To find an overall solution for great web components is not trivial, and many attempts have been made to achieve the holy grail of component-based development for the web.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In reality, component frameworks have had a short half-life. The last years has seen a rapid succession of candidates to be considered &#39;the best&#39;: Backbone, Knockout, Ember, Angular, Angular 2, React, Vue, Riot and Polymer. Find a comparison of component frameworks at <a href='http://jeffcarp.github.io/frontend-hyperpolyglot/' target='_blank'>http://jeffcarp.github.io/frontend-hyperpolyglot/</a>. History shows that what you would pick today is likely not what you would pick 18 months from now. Assuming you don&#39;t want to start from scratch and rewrite everything every 18 months, that presents you with a great challenge of how to write applications that you can expect to be both maintainable and future-safe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our best practice to deal with the evolving landscape of web components is to write webapps that are structured in a &#39;component-framework-agnostic&#39; way, where you can potentially keep existing components around, but develop new components using a newer component framework. We achieve this by avoiding the use of the two kinds of common component framework features that create unattractive &#39;lock-in&#39;: custom navigation mechanisms (routers) and framework-specific component communication implementations. We use the browser&#39;s great native navigation mechanisms (URL and browser history) as shown in Lab 4, and framework-agnostic component communication as implemented in the sample project shown below. </p>
</li>
<li><p>There is, however, light at the end of the tunnel: a W3C standard for web components appears to be forming.  Read about Standard Web Components at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components' target='_blank'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components</a>. The Chrome browser already supports Standard Web Components natively, so there is nothing extra to load, and the polyfills for the other browers are lean and fast. The most recent contender for &#39;the best&#39; component framework, Polymer, is actually developed on top of this emerging standard, by the same people at Google in charge of the standard reference implementation. We use standard web components as the default component framework for this Lab. However, our architectural concepts can also be applied when using other frameworks. May we tempt you to write a sample integration for your favorite component framework and contribute it to topseed?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Among other things, newer component frameworks solve the problem of CSS bleeding by using the &#39;Shadow DOM&#39; construct. To work with web components you should understand Shadow DOM; read a good introduction at <a href='https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/' target='_blank'>https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/</a>. We prefer it over the more recent introduction at 
<a href='https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/shadowdom' target='_blank'>https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/shadowdom</a>. &#39;Templates&#39; and &#39;HTML Imports&#39; are other Standard Web Component features which will become clear with the examples in this Lab. Finally, there is a &#39;Custom Element&#39; API to create new HTML tags. However, the implementation of this API uses &#39;class&#39; which is not supported by Internet Explorer. We will use the Custom Element API once IE has lost its remaining popularity, or when we can rule out IE in a corporate app. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Download and unzip topseed-webcomps-master.zip from <a href='https://github.com/topseed/topseed-webcomps' target='_blank'>https://github.com/topseed/topseed-webcomp</a> to your location of choice on your developer machine. Open the project in VS Code. Add the project folder /topseed-webcomps Prepros, but but ensure that Auto-Compile of Pug (Jade) is deactivated. In this project, Node.js compiles pug files on the fly when responding to HTTP requests so we don&#39;t need Preprose to precompile them. See the function &#39;pugComp&#39; in /demo-srv/util/Decider.js. Since in production we cache generated HTML responses in the CDN, there is practically no impact on production performance, but the development project is a lot cleaner. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In VS Code, open Terminal Shell (Ctrl+Shift+`), type &#39;cd demo-srv [Enter]&#39;, do the &#39;npm install [Enter]&#39; and then &#39;node index [Enter]&#39;.
You should see console output &#39;Web server listening at http://localhost:9081&#39;. In the browser, navigate to <a href='http://localhost:9081' target='_blank'>http://localhost:9081</a>, and visit Dashboard, List, Circle, Prelist and List menu items. When writing a component, we always advise to make things work outside of a component first. &#39;Prelist&#39; is a non-component list page. In VS Code, inspect its /demo-srv/root/page/list-0/index.pug. Similar to the admin linkblog in tutorial 6, this page uses &#39;/page/list/ListBusiness.js&#39; to load a list from a JSON response promise. For data binding, ListBusiness.list() uses doT.js, a fast &#39;moustache-style&#39; template library. The doT template is embedded in the page html as a script of type &#39;text/x-dot-template&#39;. Inspect ListBusiness.js, beginning with &#39;var templateText&#39; to see the JavaScript used to render the template with data and attach it to &#39;#myList&#39; in the page. You can read more about doT at <a href='http://www.javascriptoo.com/dot-js' target='_blank'>http://www.javascriptoo.com/dot-js</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inspect the component version of the list page at /demo-srv/root/page/list/index.pug. It has a custom element in the html named &#39;list-el&#39;. Custom elements must include a &#39;-&#39; (dash) in the tag name. The doT template has disappeard. The page &#39;script.&#39; loads ListBusiness.js and the List component definition from the &#39;HTML Import&#39; /_webComps/List.html, and then calls sb.compList() to render an instance of the component. In /page/list/ListBusiness.js, compare the function &#39;compList&#39; with the function &#39;list&#39; used by the non-component version. In this example, the &#39;compList&#39; function obtains the component instance with &#39;document.querySelector&#39; and calls its list(values) function. We always pass data to a component, instead of making the component load data. This keeps the component simpler and more manageable. As a result of using a component, both the page and ListBusiness are somewhat cleaner; &#39;JavaScript mess&#39; is hidden inside the component.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: Inspect the list component implementation at /demo-srv/root/_webComps/List.pug. You will find the Standard Web Component &#39;template&#39; tag that includes the node #myList previously seen in the non-component page, as well as the x-dot-template. The &#39;script.&#39; section creates a HTMLElement prototype named &#39;ListEl&#39;, specifies to attach the insulated shadow DOM (using TW.attachShadow) when an actual component instance is created from the prototype (&#39;createdCallback&#39;), and registers the element prototype as a custom element with the DOM, using TW.registerCustomElement. Also see the ListEl.list function implementation which places the databinding result into the &#39;#myList&#39; node in the shadow DOM. (You can find the the &#39;TW.&#39; helper library function implementations in /demo-srv/root/_js/setup-3.4.js.) </p>
</li>
<li><p>As of the time of writing, due to imperfect polyfills, CSS still bleeds in both directions in Firefox and Edge. For us this is not catastrophic because we already avoid most CSS namespace collisions by using BEM syntax when naming our own component styles. Remaining potential issues with third party styles used inside components will disappear once all browsers natively support Standard Web Components. Read <a href='https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/' target='_blank'>https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/</a> to lean how to use BEM; it is a best practice even when not using components. See /_webComp/circle.pug for an example of BEM inside a component. You can also attempt to insulate component CSS by using a scope div (see use of .bgauge-el in /_webComp/gauge.pug) It is also possible to write components that bleed &#39;on purpose&#39;, by making components use actual DOM vs shadow DOM. You may choose to do this if you have a well-managed, globally applicable CSS regime (ideally using BEM throughout), and are not worried about 3rd party style bleeding. Or you can use SASS to bring global CSS styles into the component, analog to using mainA.css inline with AMP as shown in tutorial 5.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a browser, go to the dashboard page at <a href='http://localhost:9081/page/dashboard/' target='_blank'>http://localhost:9081/page/dashboard/</a>. Inspect the dashboard page at /demo-srv/root/page/dashboard/index.pug for an example of using multiple components in one page. Find the reused &#39;list-el&#39;, as well as &#39;circle-el&#39; and &#39;gauge-el&#39; in the HTML. Inspect &#39;script.&#39; &#39;function UIinit&#39;. Note that The circle and gauge components are loaded from absolute URLs. This means that components can easily be shared across different web projects. In this example, ListBusiness is also used as the component communication &#39;message bus&#39; (The message bus features are found in BLX, the base class for ListBusiness.) &#39;sb.compInit&#39; connects each component to the bus, as long as the component implements a function named &#39;init&#39;. (The non-dashboard examples didn&#39;t call sb.compInit because their components did not send or receive messages.) Because ListBusiness was already present for loading list data, it was convenient to use it as message bus as well. if you prefer, you can use a separate message bus instead. Just use &#39;const _blx = new BLX(null)&#39; on the page instead and make calls to &#39;_blx.compInit(&#39;my-comp&#39;)&#39;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the dashboard page at <a href='http://localhost:9081/page/dashboard/' target='_blank'>http://localhost:9081/page/dashboard/</a>, click on one of the list links see how the circle and gauge display values change. Repeat for each list item. The list component has detected that it is enabled to communicate and has pushed hidden list data (values for circle and gauge) to the bus (rather than just opening a new tab). Because circle and gouge components are also registered with the bus, they receive the values and use their component-specific implementation to update the display. This way, components are very loosely coupled. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: Learn about the component communication implementation. First inspect the function &#39;compInit&#39; at 
/demo-srv/root/page/list/ListBusiness.js. It injects the bus into the component. Look at the &#39;ListEl.init&#39; function in /demo-srv/root/_webComps/List.pug. The component stores a reference to the bus. In the same file, look for the &#39;text/x-dot-template&#39; and see how &#39;ListEl.nav&#39; is triggered when the user clicks on the link. Inspect the function ListEl.nav. It sends the data to the bus using key &#39;mySelection&#39;, see &#39;blx.emit(&#39;mySelection&#39;. In the Circle component implementation at /topseed-webcomps/_webComp/circle.pug, find function &#39;CircleEl.init&#39; (the equivalent of &#39;ListEl.init&#39; for the Circle web compoment). In &#39;_blx.on(&#39;mySelection&#39;,..&#39; it specifies to update the component display when the bus received a message with key &#39;mySelection&#39;. In summary, the components are &#39;loosely coupled&#39; because neither component requires the presence of other components. </p>
