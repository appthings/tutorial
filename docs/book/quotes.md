_If we complicate things, they get less simple._
- Professor at Cambridge University

_... Simplifications have had a much greater long-range scientific impact than individual feats of ingenuity. The opportunity for simplification is very encouraging, because in all examples that come to mind the simple and elegant systems tend to be easier and faster to design and get right, more efficient in execution, and much more reliable than the more contrived contraptions that have to be debugged into some degree of acceptability ... Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated._
- Edsger W. Dijkstra

_Complexity is a sign of technical immaturity. Simplicity of use is the real sign of a well designed product whether it is an ATM or a Patriot missile._
- Daniel T. Ling

_Simplicity is the soul of efficiency._
- Austin Freeman, 'The Eye of Osiris'

_La perfection est atteinte non quand il ne reste rien à ajouter, mais quand il ne reste rien à enlever._
[Perfection is not achieved when nothing needs to be added, but when there is nothing left to remove.]
- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

_Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming._
- Brian Kernighan

_Der Unterschied zwischen einem guten und einem schlechten Architekten besteht heute darin, daß dieser jeder Versuchung erliegt, während der rechte ihr standhält._
[The difference between a good and a bad architect today is that one yields to every temptation, while the right one resists it.]
- Ludwig Wittgenstein

_Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it._
- Alan J. Perlis
